# Decimal to Binary Converter (Python)

This is a simple Python script that converts a decimal number into its binary representation without using built-in conversion functions like `bin()`.

## ğŸš€ Features

- Takes a decimal number as input.
- Converts the number to binary manually using division and modulus.
- Displays the binary equivalent.

## ğŸ§  How It Works

1. The user inputs a number in the decimal system.
2. The script repeatedly divides the number by 2, storing the remainders.
3. The list of remainders is reversed to form the correct binary number.
4. The binary digits are printed in order.
